Scratch-A-Roo
=============

Scratch A Roo on the BlackBerry PlayBook is an app written in ActionScript (using Adobe Flash Builder).  The app is a free app.  It lags when the app runs.  We wrote this app for the kids! LOL, if you can contribute, we'll add you to the credits, really the best we can do, thanks!
